## :star2: About the Project

<p>VoiceChatBot serves as both a multilingual interaction platform and a Japanese language teaching assistant. Features: Voice Recognition with Whisper: The bot is capable of transcribing user speech into text using the Whisper C/C++ implementation. Multilingual Interaction: By leveraging a reverse API from a website that employs ChatGPT, the bot understands and interacts in multiple languages. Text-to-Speech: The responses from ChatGPT are converted to speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library in Python. Japanese Language Teaching: The bot is designed to teach common Japanese words and phrases, focusing on conversational fluency. This is done by scraping common words and instructing ChatGPT to deliver them in a conversational style. Project Structure: Whisper Integration: Transcribes user speech to text. Chat API Connection: Sends transcribed text along with custom instructions to the ChatGPT API. gTTS Integration: Converts ChatGPT text responses to audible speech. Japanese Language Scraper: Regularly updates a list of common Japanese words and phrases for the teaching module.Whether you're looking to have a general conversation in a language of your choice or looking to learn Japanese, my bot is here to assist.</p>
